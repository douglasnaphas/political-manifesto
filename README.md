# Political Manifesto
I support the following political programs.
## Open borders
## Unconditional basic income
### Advantages
#### Optimizes for career change
The ability to take a few years off when your field contracts reduces people's incentive to struggle against economic change.

Career change may also be more necessary when technology and economic change is fast, as is the trend.
#### Diffuses equity ownership
With prospective employees not in need of a constant stream of cash, founders could rally workers to early stage enterprises with equity. Over time, this could lead to capital ownership shifting to workers.
### Implementation
#### Proportion targeting
In _The High Cost of Free Parking_, Donald Shoup advocates for laws targeting the availability of parking spaces, with prices freely floating to achieve the desired vacancy rate.

For example, legislate that 15% of the spots on a street should be available whenever measured. If too few are available, meter prices increase. If too many are available, meter prices decrease, both without legislative action.

We could do something similar for unconditional income. We could set the desired number of persons receiving no or minimal income outside of the UBI to 20%. If too many people are only receiving UBI, it's too generous, so it would shrink to get people back to work. If too few are on UBI, it's not enough for people to live decently on, so it would increase, both effects taking place without specific legislative action.

This controls against either everyone living off of UBI and standards of living declining from lack of work, and against the UBI becoming ineffective as a safety net.

It guards against everyone throughout the nation ceasing work without imposing onerous requirements on individuals, forcing them to prove that they deserve a check.
#### Phase-in
#### No minimum wage
Society is responsible for everyone's basic needs. People who buy labor are only responsible to pay its marginal product. We leave work undone when whoever hires it has to underwrite the survival of whoever does it.
## Abolition of zoning
## Prohibition of minimum parking requirements
